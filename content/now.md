Updated on 2023-08-30. In the last several months, I helped repairring and renovating my old family house in rural area and now I'm back in a place closer to downtown Nanning. But I would go back ocasionally to rural area on weekends to do some maintainance work on home appliances.

## Learning

 - German, on Duolingo, I'm able to use some basic sentence structures, need to memorize more words.

 - Japanese, on Duolingo, less progress than German, but since Japanese share some kanji with Chinese, and pronunciation of some foreign words are from English, so hopefully it will go smoother.

Hurdle for learning new foreign languages is that there are few cases where I can use those languages.

 - Typescript, to interact with a database and a bit of web frontend development.
